/**
 * Series transform pipeline (ARCHITECTURE.md §6A, Family B). A transform
 * re-buckets raw OHLC into a derived element series driven by price movement,
 * not the clock. A transform is incremental: `push` takes each source bar
 * once, in time order, and never recomputes what came before. Every push moves
 * the state, so a bar that is still forming is not pushed on each tick (that
 * counts it again every time); a live chart pushes it through a `clone` of
 * the state instead and pushes it for good once it has closed (see ./live).
 *
 * Each derived element is a Bar carrying its source formation time. Because the
 * time scale is index-based, derived elements get uniform spacing automatically
 * (the "ordinal" axis); axis labels read each element's formation time. We only
 * post-process times to be strictly increasing so the shared DataLayer keeps
 * every element on its own logical index (no collisions when many elements form
 * within one source bar).
